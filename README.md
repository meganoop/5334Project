<b>Motivation<b>
Let’s suppose you are a budding business-man wanting to open a restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina. Major factors you need to consider before starting a business is the target area in the city, the current trend in the city with regard to cuisines, popularity of competitors, price range of restaurants around the area etc… these factors can help you place your restaurant in  a most productive place with best profit outcome. Yelp provides us with a restaurant’s cuisine, location and price range information. The cuisines is divided into various types, it could be American food, Seafood, Thai, Italian etc... While locations can be roughly divided into happening areas in the city. What if there was a way to combine data of all restaurant running in a particular city and provide a visual display of which type of cuisine (food category) is doing the best in which part of the city? Which regions in the city have the most expensive restaurants and which have more affordable ones? The goal of our project is to give this visualized information. A look into the web page can give you a review of trending cuisines in different regions of the city and help you place your business in a more profitable location with the prices that run the most in that location. From the vast degree of data provided in the yelp dataset we have reduced the data set to business in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina.
